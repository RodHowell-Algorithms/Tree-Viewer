# Tree Viewer

**edu.ksu.cis.viewer** is a Java<sup>TM</sup> package of tools for viewing and manipulating trees. The package includes an application that allows the user to add and remove nodes to various types of search trees and to see the results. It also includes classes that can be used within code to display trees. These classes have also been [ported to the MicrosoftÂ® .NET Framework]().

The remainder of this page describes how to install and use the package on your own platform. The Java<sup>TM</sup> SE Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run the viewer as a stand-alone application, whereas The Java<sup>TM</sup> SE Development Kit (JDK), which includes the JRE, is required to use the class library in your own Java<sup>TM</sup> programs. Both packages can be downloaded from [java.com](https://java.com/en/).

## Installation

To install the package, simply download the JAR archive `viewer.jar`. 

## Usage

There are two main uses of this package.

1. **Search Tree Viewer.** This is the stand-alone application for manipulating and visualizing search trees. The program may be started either by opening `viewer.jar` or by executing the following from a command line in the folder containing this archive:

   <pre>
   java -jar viewer.jar
   </pre>

   To create and manipulate a tree, enter any string in the text field in the upper left-hand corner, and press either the Put button to add that string as a key to the tree, or the Remove button to remove that key from the tree. The keys will be maintained in lexicographic order. The Back and Forward buttons allow you to move through the history of your tree construction. The Clone button opens a new window with an exact copy of the tree and history in your current window; the tree in this window can then be manipulated independently.

   **Important Note:** This app treats all keys as strings. You may enter numbers, but be aware that they will be treated as strings (e.g., "10" < "5"). Virtually all of the questions I've received regarding this program have reflected a misunderstanding of this fact.

2. **Tools for viewing trees built from user code.** In order to be able to implement a tree that can be displayed using this package, you must write your tree class to implement **edu.ksu.cis.viewer.TreeInterface** (all types mentioned in what follows are from the **edu.ksu.cis.viewer** package). If you wish to have colored nodes, you will also need to provide a class that implements **Colorizer**. You may then use the **TreeDrawing**, **TreeComponent**, and/or **TreeFrame** classes to display your tree. If you didn't add this package to your CLASSPATH, you will need to specify it when you compile and run your program; e.g.:

   ```
        javac -classpath viewer.jar *.java
        java -cp .;viewer.jar MyClass.java
   ```

   (On unix, the ";" is replaced by a ":".)
